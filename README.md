This interactive calculator produces the probability of early-onset infection per 1000 babies by entering values for each maternal risk factor.


This calculator is based on the predictive model described in Karen M. Puopolo, MD, PhD, David Draper, PhD, Soora Wi, MPH, Thomas B. Newman, MD, MPH, John Zupancic, ScD, MD, Elice Lieberman, DrPH, MD, Myesha Smith, BS, and Gabriel J.
